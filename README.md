# Face-Recognition-and-Occurence-Counter
### Description
This project enables the user to add different identities(key-value pairs of name and images) which will be stored locally in the file system as a numpy file. Later this stored data is used to predict the names of the people present on the screen as well as a count of how many times the person has gone out of the frame and came back.
